## README

This repository contains code that I wrote while preparing for interviews, using the book "Elements of Programming Interviews". I did all the programming in Java. Some of my earlier solutions were just code, but recently I've been writing some commentary about what I did right and what I missed. I also compare my solution to the book's solution.
